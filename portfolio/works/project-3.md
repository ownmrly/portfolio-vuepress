In 2017, the Canadian Soccer Association sanctioned the Canadian Premier League (CPL). A Tier 1 soccer league that will begin in the spring of 2019. For their inaugural season, seven teams will face off across Canada. Some of these teams include; York, Hamilton, Winnipeg, and more. There are also rumors of expanding the league to even more teams. Cities such as Moncton, Regina, and Quebec City have all been brought up. It’s important to note that one city should not be ruled out. A city which has deep roots to soccer through the Croatian Club, German Club, Marconi Club, League1 Ontario, and city leagues. London, Ontario is a suitable host for an expansion team.
